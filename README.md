## Compatibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***NOTE***

  The addon's dummy application needs a serious upgrade.  I [@tylerturdenpants](https://github.com/tylerturdenpants) have removed as much orf the support on flexi and flexi styles that I can, but the dummy app will still produces warnings regarding SASS division.

  Additionally, this app likely has support beyond ember 3.24, but test fail locally since not all babel related issues during testing have been resolved.

  As the only supporter of this addon, a father, and a full time employee at a software company, I really need the help to fully pull flexi out and to revamp the dummy app.  Once these blockers are removed I can do the work to bring this addon into the future.

----

* Ember.js v3.16 or above
* Ember CLI v3.13 or above
* Node.js v12 or above

Tooltips and popovers made easy.
Just drop an `<AttachTooltip/>` or `<AttachPopover/>` in a parent and your floating element is ready to go!

```hbs
<button>
  Click me

  <AttachTooltip>
    I'm a tooltip!
  </AttachTooltip>
</button>

<button class="other-button">
  No click me!

  <AttachPopover 
      @class='ember-attacher'
      @hideOn='click'
      @isShown={{true}}
      @showOn='click'
  >
    I'm a popover!
  </AttachPopover>
</button>
```

See [the example site](https://tylerturdenpants.github.io/ember-attacher/) for a demonstration of all
available options.

## Installation

```bash
ember install ember-attacher
```

If you're upgrading from 1.x to 2.x [see the upgrade guide](./docs/upgrade-guide-2.0.md).


## Components

### `<AttachPopover/>`

A popover attacher.

* Has no default class or roles.
* Does not modify the target in any way.
* Adds `aria-hidden` attribute to the floating element

### `<AttachTooltip/>`

A tooltip attacher. Subclass of `<AttachPopover/>`

* Has the default class `'ember-attacher-floating ember-attacher-tooltip'`
  * The default tooltip classes can be modified by altering the `tooltipClass`
    default. See [here](#user-defined-defaults) for details on editing default values.

* Default `role` attribute of `tooltip`.
* Causes the target to gain an `aria-describedby` attribute set to the tooltip's ID.

## Options

Below is a list of all available options, along with their defaults.

```javascript
{
  // The animation used to present the animation.
  // Options: ['fade', 'fill', 'none', 'perspective', 'scale', 'shift']
  animation: 'fill',

  // Whether or not an arrow will be displayed next to the attachment.
  arrow: false,
    
  // Add listeners that will automatically call an update function
  // Pass `true` to use the Floating UI default options or Options object to override them
  // Example: { ancestorScroll: false }
  // For more details see https://floating-ui.com/docs/autoUpdate 
  autoUpdate: false,

  // A class that will be applied to the attachment.
  class: null,

  // The flip priority of the attacment.
  // Space-delimited string, any combination of ['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom']
  //
  // Example: 'left top bottom'
  flip: null,

  // The delay, in milliseconds, before the attachment will be hidden.
  hideDelay: 0,

  // The duration, in milliseconds, of the hide animation.
  hideDuration: 300,

  // Events that will cause the attachment to hide, typically in reference to the target.
  //
  // Space-delimited string, any combination of:
  // ['click', 'clickout', 'mouseleave blur escapekey']
  hideOn: 'mouseleave blur escapekey',

  // Interactive tooltips will not close when clicked or hovered over.
  interactive: false,

  // Set this to true if you have an interactive attachment that hides on mouseout and the
  // attachment is offset from its target. This should only be the case if you are using custom
  // CSS that offsets that attachment.
  isOffset: false,

  // Whether or not the attachment is initially shown.
  isShown: false,

  // If true, the attachment will only be inserted into the DOM on the first "show" trigger.
  // Useful for performance reasons, but will hide your attachment from search engines.
  lazyRender: false,

  // A middleware array that will be merged into computePosition options
  middleware: null,

  // A function to be fired when the attachment's visibility changes. The new visibility is passed
  // to the function as an arg.
  onChange: null,

  // The initial position of the attachment.
  // Options: ['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom']
  placement: 'top',

  // The container where the attachment's DOM will be inserted.
  floatingElementContainer: '.ember-application',

  // An options object that will be passed to Floating UI "computePosition" function.
  floatingUiOptions: null,

  // NOT RECOMMENDED: We currently allow you to pass an explicit target, but this may be removed
  // in a future release.
  // Please provide your thoughts here: https://github.com/kybishop/ember-attacher/issues/109
  explicitTarget: null,

  // Whether or not to render the attachment in place in the DOM, as opposed to
  // on the floatingElementContainer. NOTE: Rendering in place can cause z-index issues.
  renderInPlace: false,

  // The delay, in milliseconds, before the attachment will be shown.
  showDelay: 0,

  // The duration, in milliseconds, of the show animation.
  showDuration: 300,

  // Events on the target that will cause the attachment to show. For performance reasons, we
  // recommend using some combination of 'mouseenter', 'focus', and 'click'
  showOn: 'mouseenter focus',

  // Whether to add event listeners for attachment show and hide in the capturing phase rather
  // than the bubbling phase. This should be set to true when there are elements on the page that
  // are stopping event propagation in the bubbling phase, and as a result preventing correct
  // showing and hiding of popovers and tooltips.
  useCapture: false
}
```

## User-defined defaults

User-defined defaults can be set in the consuming app or addon's config/environment.js. These defaults will be applied to every `<AttachPopover/>` and `<AttachTooltip/>`

```javascript
// config/environment.js

module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    emberAttacher: {
      animation: 'shift',
      arrow: true
    }
  };
}
```

You can also set the user-defined defaults separately like so:

```javascript
// config/environment.js

module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    emberAttacher: {
      tooltip: {
        animation: 'fade',
        arrow: true
      },
      popover: {
        animation: 'shift',
        arrow: false
      }
    }
  };
}
```

And finally you can do shared defaults along with user-defined separated defaults:

```javascript
// config/environment.js

module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    emberAttacher: {
      showDuration: 300,
      hideDuration: 300,
      tooltip: {
        animation: 'fade',
        arrow: true
      },
      popover: {
        animation: 'shift',
        arrow: false
      }
    }
  };
}
```

The full list of editable defaults can be seen [here](https://github.com/kybishop/ember-attacher/blob/master/addon/defaults.js).

## Styles

`ember-attacher` provides [styles](https://github.com/kybishop/ember-attacher/blob/master/addon/styles/addon.scss#L85) for the default tooltip class, `ember-attacher-tooltip`, but no styles are included for `{{attach-popover}}`.

Example styling for a popover [can be found in the dummy app](https://github.com/kybishop/ember-attacher/blob/master/tests/dummy/app/styles/app.scss#L132). Note how the arrow must also be styled to match the popover (background color, size, etc.)

## Testing

Use the `isVisible()` test helper to check if an attachment is visible.

```javascript
import { click, find } from 'ember-native-dom-helpers';
import { isVisible } from 'ember-attacher';

test('example', async function(assert) {
  this.render(hbs`
    <button id="toggle">
      Click me, captain!

      <AttachPopover 
          @id='attachment'
          @hideOn='click'
          @showOn='click'
      >
        Click-toggled popover
      <AttachPopover/>
    </button>
  `);

  const attachment = find('#attachment');

  assert.equal(isVisible(attachment), false, 'Initially hidden');

  await click('#toggle');

  // You can also pass in a selector
  assert.equal(isVisible('#attachment'), true, 'Now shown');
});
```

## FAQ

### How animations are implemented

Attachments are composed of two containers:

* [An outer container](https://github.com/kybishop/ember-attacher/blob/master/addon/templates/components/attach-popover.hbs#L2) for positioning (via [floating-ui](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui)).
* [An inner container](https://github.com/kybishop/ember-attacher/blob/master/addon/templates/components/attach-popover.hbs#L12) for the content. This is the container that is animated.

The outer container is positioned right next to the target via the CSS `transform` property. The inner container is required because animations also use `transform`, which would otherwise conflict with the container's position.

`transform` and `tansition-duration` are the CSS magic that allows animations to smoothly shift up/down, left/right, etc.

Note that animations require an implementation for each position (left, right, top, and bottom):
